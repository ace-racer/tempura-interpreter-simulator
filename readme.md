# A simple interpreter and simulator for the Tempura language in Java. #

## Project abstract ##

In a real life system, before a circuit is designed and fabricated, generally a software model of the system is 
designed to simulate it. The simulation model is used to compare the behavior of the model to the behavior 
of the actual circuit. In this project the model of synchronous sequential circuit is built using formulae of 
temporal logic. Programs representing the circuit are written in Tempura. An interpreter to parse the Tempura 
statements has been developed. A graphical user interface is also made that takes these user programs as 
input and displays the output of the program in the form of visual graphs.
